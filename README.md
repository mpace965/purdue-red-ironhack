## Objective

The goal of this app is to take its users from West Lafayette to Chicago with a happy face!

It takes into account many different factors to choose the best time within the next year for your trip to Chicago.

### Data

To accomplish this task, many different data sets were used.

#### [City of Chicago Crime Rates](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2010-2014/82c5-g7da) from 2014

This data set was downloaded and manipulated using [csvkit](http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/0.9.1/index.html) to create a histogram that represented how many crimes were committed each day. The same program was then used to create the resulting crime-2014.min.json file.
